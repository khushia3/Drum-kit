🛠️ How It Works
Each drum button is tied to a key (W, A, S, D, J, K, L)

When a button is clicked or a key is pressed:

A corresponding sound is played using the Audio object

A visual animation is triggered for feedback

💡 Technologies Used
HTML5 – to structure the drum kit layout

CSS3 – to style the buttons and layout

JavaScript (Vanilla) – to handle user input and play sounds
